Machine Learning for Docs projects developed in collaboration with Prof. Raja Adal at Pitt.

/pylon5/hm5fp1p/data/ is the location of the original 6000x4000 images. About 108 of them have human-annotated stamps in labelme format and the rest are unannotated. The annotated and unannotated images are mixed together in one image folder. There are a total of 389 jpeg files. The annotations are xml files. There are 126 xml files.

/pylon5/pscstaff/myilmaz/Stamps_Data is where I place large datasets I want to share with the group. This is where the predicted machine-annotated images (1800x1200) will be located in labelme format. They will be in folders labelled by Stage.

/pylon5/pscstaff/myilmaz/Stamps_Data/original_stamps_images is the location of the original 100 training images but resized to 1200x1800. There are no annotations in this folder, just images, although these images were annotated when they were a larger size (6000x4000). These images can be used for adding page annotations using LabelMe.
